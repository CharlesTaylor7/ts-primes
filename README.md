# ts-primes
An ordinary typescript program that generates prime numbers

As we all know, Typescript is a functional immutable language with pattern matching and recursion.
 It lacks loops and higher order functions. It has no tail call optimization and a very short max call stack of only 1000 frames. 
Adding numbers larger than 1000 is not allowed.
